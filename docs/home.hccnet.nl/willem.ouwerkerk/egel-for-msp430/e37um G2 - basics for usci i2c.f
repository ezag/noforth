(* E37UM G2 - For noForth C&V 200202: USCI I2C on MSP430G2553 using pull-ups.
   The bitrate values are for an 8 MHz DCO, for 16 MHz they should be doubled.
   This is a better version, the routines work more solid. Code Vsn 1.02

  The most hard to find data are those for the selection registers.
  To find the data for the selection register of Port-1 here 026 and
  041 you have to go to the "Port Schematics". For P1.6 and P1.7 these
  are page 48 and 49 of SLAS735J.PDF These tables say which function 
  will be on each I/O-bit at a specific setting of the registers.

  Address 026 - P1SEL, port-1 selection register
  Address 041 - P1SEL2, port-1 selection register 2

  A description of USCI as I2C can be found in SLAU144J.PDF from page
  449 to page 473, the register description starts at page 468. The
  UCB0CTL0 register selects the SPI- or I2C-mode we are in.

  Connect the I2C-print from the Forth users group or any other module
  with I2C chips. Connect the power lines, P1.7 to SDA and P1.6 to SCL,
  note that two 10k pullup resistors has te be mounted and jumper P1.6 to
  the green led has to be removed, that's it. The minimum I2C clock for
  this code is 2500 Hz, that is a bitrate divisor of 6400.

  User words: >DEV  {I2WRITE)  {I2WRITE  {I2READ)  {I2READ
              I2STOP}  I2IN  I2IN}  I2OUT  I2OUT}  I2C?
              SETUP-I2C  {I2ACK?}  {POLL}

  An example, first execute SETUP-I2C  After that the I2C is setup as a
  master. Sent byte 'b' to an I2C device with address 'a'.
